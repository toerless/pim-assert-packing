Dear RFC Editor,

Thanks a lot for the work. I am always baffled by the meticulousness of your work. 

Changes look overall very good, except for the following:

  -12 said:
     For example various L2 technologies for rings provide sub 50
     msec failover mechanisms, something not possible equally with an L3
     subnet based ring.

  rfc-editor-draft says:
     For example, various L2 technologies for rings provide	
     sub-50 msec failover mechanisms, something not possible equally with	
     a ring based on an L3 subnet.

  please fix to:
     For example, various L2 technologies for rings provide	
     sub-50 msec failover mechanisms, something not possible equally with	
     a ring composed from L3 subnets.

inline following.

I think the recast sentence reads a bit better than just the remove "PIM-SM" option.
Please use the recast option.

Yes, consistency is always nice, and the shorter version "P=0/1"
would fit well the desire for terseness in PIM RFCs. Please change accordingly.

It is still a too-long "german" ( ;-)) sentence and it may not be obvious what
context is "for which", and what context is "under which".

Proposed rewrite:

The protocol or system conditions for which an implementation
wants to send PackedAsserts instead of Asserts are out of scope for this specification.
Protocol conditions include protocol triggers such as data-triggered asserts or Assert
Timer (AT) expiry-triggered asserts, and system conditions include
high or low load or control plane packet reception rates.

Theree would be subtle differences in the interpretations of these sentences,

I guess i am just showing my lack of understanding of subtleties of the
english language and what seems to be fixed terms. I used "from other reason"
so that this term uses the same word "from" as "from reception-triggered".
If the right word to say the same thing as "from reception-triggered" with "other reasons"
is "for" instead of "from", then please replace "from" with "for".

Sure, use same word case or situation in both occurrences. Whichever seems

Its not really IMHO a defintion of the semantic of OptionType, but only
of value 40 of OptionType. Hence we could only write something like:

* OptionLength 0: The Packet Assert Capaility has no OptionValue.

No strong opinion whether this is needed. Roll a dice ;-)

I guess i am a fan of explicitly writing IPv4, and there are currently 17 instances
of that in the draft, so please use IPv4.

However, i fear that i may be part of some minority amongst RFC authors, and
that most RFC use "IP" to refer to (only) IPv4. Whereas i am thinking that readers
may not always understand this (but instead think IP could imply either IPv4 or IPv6),
hence i avoid the term IP, unless its used in contexts where it does not matter whether
IPv4 and/or IPv6 are implied.

This seems to be some terminology question for consistency across RFCs about
which you as RFC editors might want to have an opinion.

Change is good. Maybe change
   possible mis-parsing if this field was used
with
   possible mis-parsing the message as an RFC7761 assert message if this field was not zero-filled.

ANd use in both places.

Good catch with the duplication.
Please remove duplication.

How about to lead in with:

    Assert Record [1...M]:

Or

    Assert Record, [M]:

That way one would not have to read through all text to find M.
Aka: quickly being ale to find M was the reason for creating an
entry for it.

Format as you like. Not worth having another discussion round for this.

But that proposal would ignore that IANA has also changed the row

How about changing the lead-in text paragraph to:

as follows to include the Packed and Aggregated two flags bit.

Re-reading the text, it seems to me as if the tail-end explanation of
RFC7490 and RFC7431 is at the wrong place. It is best included in the
prior sentence ("If such L2 rings ...").  So, i would sugest to
rewrite the two sentence as follows, and separarte the second out as
a new paragraph. 

If such L2 rings were to be replaced
by L3 rings just to avoid PIM asserts, then this would result in the
need for a complex choice of a sub-50 msec IP unicast failover
solution, such as [RFC7490] with IP repair tunnels,
as well as a separate sub-50 msec IP multicast failover solution,
such as [RFC7431] with dedicated ring support.

The mere fact that by running at the IP layer, different solutions
for IP unicast and multicast are required, makes them more difficult
to operate, they typically require more expensive hardware and
often this leads to non-support of the IP multicast part.

No, please keep these parenthsis cases.

These cases remind me of the discussion
we had in another recent RFC of mine, where an AD wanted to have some
term that could also be misread as ambiguous to be better qualified, and
we did this with parenthsis. Aka: in these cases, the parenthesis are
explicitly used to incide a stronger de-ambiguation, but a term
that we should not actually need, and that we do not want to really define.
E.g.: "non-packed".

But of course consistency, aka: replace second "not packet" with "non-packed".

Yes, please fix as you see fit. I totally struggle finding any logic
in (non) capitalization of these term variations, so i am very happy that
you understand this so well.

As i said, i can not find a logic for when or when not to capitalize any
such terms in Text, so i am trying my best to at least keep consistent. I
always feel as if terms that are names should be capitalized, which is
what i did in these cases, but personally i would be happier the less
capitalization was used.

Please apply your own preferences.
