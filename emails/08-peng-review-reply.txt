changed to: otherwise the Source Address is set to 0 in the assert record.

Yeah.. reconsidering what we do, it's not ideal to describe it as a a layer. Changed to:

are logically new packetization options for assert records in addition to the (not packed) {{RFC7761}} Assert Message.

Fun side node: when we finalized RFC8815 with RFC Editor we made PIM-SSM become
a well-known term in https://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/abbrev.expansion.txt,
so everybody in the IETF should know it's expansion (as opposed to PIM-SM)) ;-),
and therefore it is not mandatory to expand the term on first use.
(expanded anyhow ;-)

I rather changed to "PIM Asserts occur"

"PIM Assert Packing Hello Option" - fixed.

Did check a few other RFCs (including RFC7761) and this is never expanded.
