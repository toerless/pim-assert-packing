Thanks, Eric.

The simple answer is: No, the document intends to solve the problem for
subnets with 3 or more PIM routers. So for the purpose of just the document
being correct i think we're fine.

Having said this:

The complex answer is: There can be asserts not caused by PIM itself, but
because of IGMP/MLD, and these can happen with 2 or more routers. But the
document does not explicitly try to address them, because there should be
better solutions than asserts (and hence assert packing) to solve duplicates
resulting from IGMP/MLD. So i would not even want to promote assert packing
to solve this issue, even if it potentially could help as long as the
better solutions are not deployed.
