Thanks. I'll continue to push PIM work to use PIM over TCP as much as possible.

Alas, for asserts this does not solve the problem of having to deliver them
as fast as possible (hence this draft), because of the fundamental CC misdesign
of PIM for the data plane:

"Oh, someone wants traffic from me. Let me start sending, and if that should
 overload the network badly because its all duplicates, well, hopefully someone
 will quickly send me an asserts to stop me" ...

John provided replacement text and i added a hopefully trivial but common
example reasoning in a second paragraph. This is now section 3.3.1.5.

As i admitted to John, discussion about performance enhancing functions and
their implementations are challenging to get done "right" in a standards
spec - and trying to come up with a much harder textual split between
normative and informative aspects of this might not have improved readability.
I hope this is well readible now after JohnC's thorough review and my feedback
to it.
