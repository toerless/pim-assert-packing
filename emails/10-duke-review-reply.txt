Thanks, Martin.

I just uploaded -11 which has resolved John Scudders DISCUSS and intends to answer
all open COMMENTS including yours.

Diff here:

Wrt. your feedback:

That last paragraph of 3.3.1 was rewriten with one paragraph from 
John Scutter and one example in a second paragraph at the end from me. This
is now section 3.3.1. It has less of an instructive (may, should) character
and more of a descriptive character, because ultimately, we have a very
simply described, but complex to achieve goal (minimize number of duplicate data packet),
and when trying to achieve this through larger and larger assertsignalling  packets,
the impact of several implementation and user traffic dependending impacts start to overlap.


Cheers
