> 610   packet type and subtype. The assignment is requested permanent for
> 611   IANA when this document is published as an RFC. The string TBD
> 612   should be replaced by the assigned values accordingly.
> 
> [major] For the new registry:
> 
> - request IANA to create one (they are not assigned)
> - what is the registration policy (rfc8126)
> - please include a table showing structure of the registry and the current
> assignments
> - where should the registry be located?
>

> [major] Which registry should the type.subtype be assigned from?

> Note that §3.* seems to specify multiple values -- see my comments there.

> Not needed, that is what the requests are for.

> 616   As described in section 6.1 in RFC7761, the forged assert message
> 617   may cause the legitimate designated forwarder to stop forwarding
> 618   traffic to the LAN. And the packed function defined in this
> 619   document, may make this situation worse, because it will affect
> 620   multiple flows with a single packed assert. That is in case one
> 621   forged packed assert message is accept, all the (S,G) or (*,G)
> 622   carried in this message may be stopped forwarding from one or more
> 623   legitimate designated forwarders. The general security function,
> 624   such as authentication function defined in RFC7761, or the necessary
> 625   PIM filtering method, will do good help to avoid the forged assert
> 626   message.

>    As described in Section 6.1 of [RFC7761], a forged Assert message
