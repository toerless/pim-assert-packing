Thanks Stig.

in -09:

a) I have removed the Count field and added a "Zero" field to resolve the issue we discussed earlier.

b) IANA: I have changed rev to rfc8736bis and changed "Reserved" to "Unused" in the IANA ask picture.

   Also added RFC-Editor note that the two asked for bits are "placeholder".

Cheers
