I would not know right now which RFC to consult for official critera, but
technically off the top of my head:

- Its an on-the-wire-change, so impacts interoperability

- Asserts are a known issue to limit RFC7761 scale and relaibility/performance under scale/load
  because of duplicate packets, overloads caused by them, loss casusused by them.

- Proposed solution is well simple optimizationn, so no big difficult new concepts that would
  have us go for experimental first.

With anything performance optimization there is of course a good amount that lies
in implementations finding the minimum complexity implementation for the best performance
improvement. Thats not something that can fully be captured, but we tried to do the best
in the spec. Some more example/details are given in reply to John Scudder.

Further replies inline below as expected.

I have changed this to be like the first sentence of the Intro, aka: scoped to
LANs where PIM is used. I think "often" is fair because PIM is really used
primarily in professional networks, and those do often use redundant
routers for resiliency against router failure. The mayor case where in
my experience this doesn't mean redundant routers at the PIM layer is when
you have some vendor-specific chassis-redundancy solution instead of an IETF/PIM
standards based redundancy setup. That is why i picked "often" instead of "most often".

Expanded paragraph to be more precise and give examples:

These L3 ring designs are specifically undesirable, when particular L2 technologies are needed.
For example various L2 technologies for rings provide sub 50msec failover
mechanisms that will benefit IP unicast and multicast alike without any
added complexity to the IP layer (forwarding or routing). If such L2 rings where to be replaced
by L3 rings just to avoid PIM asserts, then this would result in the need for
a complex choice of of a sub 50 msec IP unicast failover solutions as well
as a sub 50 msec IP multicast failover solution. The mere fact that by
operating at the IP layer, different solutions for IP unicast and multicast
are required makes them more difficult to operate, they typically require more
expensive hardware and therefore most often, they are not even available
on the target equipment, such as {{RFC7490}} with IP repair tunnels for IP unicast or
{{RFC7431}} for IP multicast.

Haha. Isn't this a beautify way to hide the bits-on-the-wire overhead of IPv6
from specs ;-)

Added:

The Encoded-Group and Encoded-Unicast address formats are specified in Section 4.9.1 of
{{RFC7761} for IP and IPv6.

Fixed.


Thanks!
