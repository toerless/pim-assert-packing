I hope the following rewrite solves the concern: 

From:

 *  M: The number of Assert Records in the message.  Derived from the
      length of the packet carrying the message.

   The format of each Assert Record is the same as the PIM assert
   message body as specified in Section 4.9.6 of [RFC7761].

To:
 *  Assert Record: formatted according to Figure 4, wich is the same
    as the PIM assert message body as specified in Section 4.9.6 of [RFC7761].
    The number M of Assert Records is determined from the packet size.

I found this for M:  in 4.3 and 4.4 (change in 4.4 equivalent).
Did not find other occurrances of this textual inconsistency.

Pls let me know if you see insufficiencies in that answer that would
cause a need for draft text enhancements in your opinion (such as what
i wrote to Robert).
