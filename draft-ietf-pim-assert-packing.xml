    <abstract>


<t>LANs often have more than one upstream router.
When PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), including PIM Source Specific-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM), is used, this
can lead to duplicate IP multicast packets being forwarded by these
PIM routers.  PIM Assert messages are used to elect a single forwarder for
each IP multicast traffic flow between these routers.</t>

<t>This document defines a mechanism to send
and receive information for multiple IP multicast flows 
in a single PackedAssert message. This optimization reduces the
total number of PIM packets on the LAN and can therefore speed up
the election of the single forwarder, reducing the number of duplicate IP
multicast packets incurred.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>In PIM-SM shared LAN networks, there is typically more than one
upstream router. When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN, from
different upstream routers, assert packets are sent from these
routers to elect a single forwarder according to <xref target="RFC7761"/>. The PIM
assert messages are sent periodically to keep the assert state. The
PIM assert message carries information about a single multicast
source and group, along with the corresponding metric-preference and
metric of the route towards the source or PIM Rendezvous Point (RP).</t>

<t>This document defines a mechanism to encode the information of 
multiple PIM Assert messages into a single PackedAssert message.
This allows to send and receive information for multiple IP multicast flows 
in a single PackedAssert message without changing the PIM Assert state
machinery. It reduces the total number of PIM packets on the LAN and can
therefore speed up the election of the single forwarder, reducing the number
of duplicate IP multicast packets.  This can particularly be helpful when
there is traffic for a large number of multicast groups or SSM channels and
PIM packet processing performance of the routers is slow.</t>

<section anchor="problem-statement"><name>Problem Statement</name>

<t>PIM Asserts occur in many deployments. See <xref target="use-case-examples"/>
for explicit examples and explanations of why it is often not possible to avoid.</t>

<t>PIM assert state depends mainly on the network topology.
As long as there is a layer 2 network with more than 2 PIM routers,
there may be multiple upstream routers, which can cause duplicate
multicast traffic to be forwarded and assert process to occur.</t>

<t>As the multicast services become widely deployed, the
number of multicast entries increases, and a large number of assert
messages may be sent in a very short period when multicast data
packets trigger PIM assert processing in the shared LAN networks.
The PIM routers need to process a large number of PIM assert small
packets in a very short time. As a result, the device load is very
large. The assert packet may not be processed in time or even
discarded, thus extending the time of traffic duplication in the
network.</t>

<t>The PIM Assert mechanism can only be avoided by designing the network
to be without transit subnets with multiple upstream routers. For
example, an L2 ring between routers can sometimes be reconfigured to be a ring
of point-to-point subnets connected by the routers. These L2/L3 topology
changes are undesirable though, when they are only done to enable IP multicast
with PIM because they increase the cost of introducing IP multicast with PIM.</t>

<t>These designs are also not feasible when specific L2 technologies are needed.
For example various L2 technologies for rings provide sub 50msec failover
mechanisms, something not possible equally with an L3 subnet based ring. 
Likewise, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking mechanisms would require an
L2 topology that can not simply be replaced by an L3 topology.
L2 sub-topologies can also significantly reduce the cost of deployment.</t>

<section anchor="specification"><name>Specification</name>

<t>This document defines three elements in support of PIM assert packing:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The PIM Assert Packing Hello Option.</t>
  <t>The encoding of PackedAssert messages.</t>
  <t>How to send and receive PackedAssert messages.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="pim-assert-packing-hello-option"><name>PIM Assert Packing Hello Option</name>

<t>The PIM Assert Packing Hello Option (<xref target="assert-packing-option"/>) is used to announce support
for the assert packing mechanisms specified in this document.
PackedAssert messages (<xref target="assert-packing-formats"/>) 
MUST NOT be used unless all PIM routers in the same subnet announce this option.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="assert-packing-formats"><name>Assert Packing Message Formats</name>

<t>The PIM Assert message, as defined in Section 4.9.6 of <xref target="RFC7761"/>,
describes the parameters of a (*,G) or (S,G) assert through the
following information elements: Rendezvous Point Tree flag (R), Source Address, Group
Address, Metric and Metric Preference. This document calls this
information an assert record.</t>

<t>Assert packing introduces two new PIM Assert message encodings
through the allocation and use of two flags in the PIM Assert
message header <xref target="I-D.ietf-pim-rfc8736bis"/>, the Packed (P) and the Aggregated (A)
flags.</t>

<t>If the (P)acked flag is 0, the message is a (non-packed) PIM Assert message
as specified in <xref target="RFC7761"/>. See <xref target="rfc7761-assert-message"/>. In this case,
the (A) flag MUST be set to 0, and MUST be ignored on receipt.</t>

<t>If the (P) flag is 1, then the message is
called a PackedAssert message and the type and hence
encoding format of the payload is determined by the (A) flag.</t>

<t>If A=0, then the message body is a sequence of assert records. This is called a "Simple PackedAssert" message. See <xref target="simple-packedassert-message"/>.</t>

<t>If A=1, then the message body is a sequence of aggregated assert records. This is called an "Aggregated PackedAssert". See <xref target="aggregated-packedassert-message"/>.</t>

<t>Two aggregated assert record types are specified.</t>

<t>The "Source Aggregated Assert Record", see <xref target="s-assert-record"/>,
encodes one (common) Source Address, Metric and Metric Preference as well as a list
of one or more Group Addresses.  Source Aggregated Assert Records provide
a more compact encoding than the Simple PackedAssert message format when multiple (S,G) flows share the same source S. 
A single Source Aggregated Assert Record with n Group Addresses represents the information of
assert records for (S,G1)...(S,Gn).</t>

<t>The "RP Aggregated Assert Record", see <xref target="rp-assert-record"/>,
encodes one common Metric and Metric Preference as
well as a list of "Group Records", each of which encodes a Group Address
and a list of zero or more Source Addresses with a count. This is called an
"RP Aggregated Assert Record", because with standard RPF according to (<xref target="RFC7761"/>),
all the Group Addresses that use the same RP will have the same Metric and Metric Preference.</t>

<t>RP Aggregation Records provide a more compact encoding than the Simple PackedAssert message format
for (*,G) flows.  The Source Address is optionally used by <xref target="RFC7761"/> assert procedures
to indicate the source(s) that triggered the assert, otherwise the Source Address is set to 0 in the
assert record.</t>

<t>Both Source Aggregated Assert Records and RP Aggregated Assert Records also include the
R flag which maintains its semantic from <xref target="RFC7761"/> but also distinguishes
the encodings. Source Aggregated Assert Records have R=0, as (S,G) assert records do in <xref target="RFC7761"/>.
RP Aggregated Assert Records have R=1, as (*,G) assert records do in <xref target="RFC7761"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="packedassert-mechanism"><name>PackedAssert Mechanism</name>

<t>PackedAsserts do not change the <xref target="RFC7761"/> PIM assert state machine specification. Instead,
sending and receiving of PackedAssert messages as specified in the following subsections are logically
new packetization options for assert records in addition to the (not packed) <xref target="RFC7761"/> Assert Message. 
There is no change to the assert record information elements transmitted or
their semantic. They are just transmitted in fewer but larger packets and fewer total number of bytes used to encode the information elements. In result, PIM routers should be able to send/receive assert records faster and/or with less processing overhead.</t>

<section anchor="sending-packedassert-messages"><name>Sending PackedAssert messages</name>

<t>When using assert packing, the regular <xref target="RFC7761"/> Assert message encoding with A=0 and P=0 is
still allowed to be sent.  Routers are free to choose which PackedAssert message format they send 
- simple (<xref target="simple-packedassert-message"/>) and/or aggregated (<xref target="aggregated-packedassert-message"/>).</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>When any PIM routers on the LAN have not signaled support for Assert Packing,
implementations MUST send only Asserts and MUST NOT send PackedAsserts under
any condition.</t>
  <t>Implementations SHOULD support sending of PackedAssert messages.
It is out of scope of this specification for which conditions, such as data-triggered asserts or 
Assert Timer (AT) expiry-triggered asserts, or under which conditions (such as high load) an implementation
will send PackedAsserts instead of Asserts.</t>
  <t>Implementations are expected to specify in documentation and/or management interfaces (such as a YANG model),
which PackedAssert message formats they can send and under which conditions they will send them.</t>
  <t>Implementations SHOULD be able to indicate to the operator (such as through a YANG model)
how many Assert and PackedAssert messages were sent/received and how many assert records were sent/received.</t>
  <t>Implementations that introduce support for PackedAsserts after support for Asserts SHOULD support configuration that disables PackedAssert operations.</t>
  <t>A configuration option SHOULD be available to disable PackedAssert operations.
Implementations that introduce support for assert packing from day one of
their <xref target="RFC7761"/> implementation MAY omit this configuration option.</t>
</list></t>

<t>When a PIM router has an assert record ready to send according to
<xref target="RFC7761"/>, it calls one of the following functions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>send Assert(S,G) / send Assert(*,G) (<xref target="RFC7761"/>, Section 4.2),</t>
  <t>Send Assert(S,G) / SendAssertCancel(S,G) (<xref target="RFC7761"/>, Section 4.6.1),</t>
  <t>Send Assert(*,G) / Send AssertCancel(*,G) (<xref target="RFC7761"/>, Section 4.6.2)</t>
  <t>send Assert(S,G) (<xref target="RFC7761"/>, Section 4.8.2).</t>
</list></t>

<t>If sending of PackedAsserts is possible on the network,
instead of sending an Assert message with an assert record, any of these
calls MAY instead result in the PIM implementation remembering the assert record,
and continueing with further processing for other flows which may result in additional assert records.</t>

<t>PIM MUST then create PackedAssert messages from the remembered assert records
and schedule them for sending according to the considerations of the following
subsections.</t>

<section anchor="handling-of-reception-triggered-assert-records"><name>Handling of reception-triggered assert records.</name>

<t>Avoiding additional delay because of assert packing compared to immediate scheduling of
Assert messages is most critical for assert records that are triggered by
reception of data or reception of asserts against which the router
is in the "I am Assert Winner" state.  In these cases the router
SHOULD send out an Assert or PackedAssert message containing this assert record
as soon as possible to minimize the time in which duplicate IP multicast packets can occur.</t>

<t>To avoid additional delay in this case, the router should employ appropriate
assert packing and scheduling mechanisms, as explained here.</t>

<t>Asserts/PackedAsserts created from reception-triggered assert records should be scheduled
for serialization with a higher priority than those created from other reasons. They
should also bypass other PIM messages that can create significant bursts, such as PIM join/prune messages.</t>

<t>When there is no reception-triggered Assert/PackedAssert messages currently being serialized
on the interface or scheduled to be sent, the router should immediately generate
and schedule an Assert or PackedAssert message without further assert packing.</t>

<t>If there are one or more reception-triggered Assert/PackedAssert messages already serializing
and/or scheduled to be serialized on the outgoing interface, then the router can use the time
until the last of those messages will have finished serializing for PIM processing of further
conditions that may result in additional reception-triggered assert records as well as packing of these assert
records without introducing additional delay.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="handling-of-timer-expiry-triggered-assert-records"><name>Handling of timer expiry-triggered assert records.</name>

<t>Asserts triggered by expiry of the AT on an assert winner are not time-critical because
they can be scheduled in advance and because the Assert_Override_Interval parameter of <xref target="RFC7761"/> already
creates a 3 second window in which such assert records can be sent, received, and processed before
an assert loser's state would expire and duplicate IP multicast packets could occur.</t>

<t>An example mechanism to allow packing of AT expiry-triggered assert records on assert winners is
to round the AT to an appropriate granularity such as 100msec.  This will cause AT for multiple
(S,G) and/or (*,G) states to expire at the same time, thus allowing them to be easily packed
without changes to the assert state machinery.</t>

<t>AssertCancel messages have assert records with an infinite metric and can use assert packing
as any other Assert. They are sent on Override Timer (OT) expiry and can be packed for example
with the same considerations as AT expiry-triggered assert records.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="beneficial"><name>Beneficial delay in sending PackedAssert messages</name>

<t>Delay in sending PackedAsserts beyond what was discussed in prior subsections can still be beneficial when
it causes the overall amount of (possible) duplicate IP multicast packets to decrease in a condition with
large number of (S,G) and/or (*,G), compared to the situation in which an implementation only
sends Assert messages.</t>

<t>This delay can simply be used in implementations because it can not support the (more advanced)
mechanisms described above, and this longer delay can be achieved by some simpler mechanism 
(such as only periodic generation of PackedAsserts) and still achieves an overall reduction
in duplicate IP multicast packets compared to sending only Asserts.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="handling-assertpackedassert-message-loss"><name>Handling Assert/PackedAssert message loss</name>

<t>When Asserts are sent, a single packet loss will result only in continued or new
duplicates from a single IP multicast flow.  Loss of (non AssertCancel) PackedAssert impacts
duplicates for all flows packed into the PackedAssert and may result in the need
for re-sending more than one Assert/PackedAssert, because of the possible inability to pack the assert records in this condition.  Therefore, routers SHOULD support mechanisms allowing for PackedAsserts and Asserts to
be sent with an appropriate Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP, <xref target="RFC2475"/>), such as Expedited Forwarding  (EF), to minimize their loss, especially
when duplicate IP multicast packets could cause congestion and loss.</t>

<t>Routers MAY support a configurable option for sending PackedAssert messages twice in short order
(such as 50msec apart), to overcome possible loss, but only when the following two conditions
are met.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The total size of the two PackedAsserts is less than the total size of equivalent Assert messages,</t>
  <t>The condition of the assert records flows in the PackedAssert is such that the router
can expect that their reception by PIM routers will not trigger Assert/PackedAsserts replies.
This condition is true for example when sending an assert record while becoming or being Assert Winner (Action A1/A3 in <xref target="RFC7761"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="optimal-degree-of-assert-record-packing"><name>Optimal degree of assert record packing</name>

<t>The optimal target packing size will vary depending on factors
including implementation characteristics and the required operating
scale. At some point, as the target packing size is varied from the
size of a single non-packed Assert, to the MTU size, a size can be
expected to be found where the router can achieve the required
operating scale of (S,G) and (*,G) flows with minimum duplicates.
Beyond this size, a further increase in the target packing size would
not produce further benefits, but might introduce possible negative
effects such as the incurrence of more duplicates on loss.</t>

<t>For example, in some router implementations, the total number of
packets that a control plane function such as PIM can send/receive
per unit of time is a more limiting factor than the total amount
of data across these packets. As soon as the packet size is large
enough for the maximum possible payload throughput, increasing the
packet size any further may still reduce the processing overhead
of the router, but may increase latency incurred in creating the
packet in a way that may increase duplicates compared to smaller
packets.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="receiving-packedassert-messages"><name>Receiving PackedAssert messages</name>

<t>Upon reception of a PackedAssert message, the PIM router logically
converts its payload into a sequence of assert records that are then processed
as if an equivalent sequence of Assert messages were received according to <xref target="RFC7761"/>.</t>

the same Metric Preference and Metric. Typically this is the case
for all (*,G) using the same RP, but the encoding is not limited
to only (*,G) using the same RP because the RP address is not

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC7761"/> apply to the extensions
defined in this document.</t>

<t>This document packs multiple assert records in a single message. As
described in Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC7761"/>, a forged Assert message could
cause the legitimate designated forwarder to stop forwarding traffic
to the LAN. The effect may be amplified when using a PackedAssert message.</t>

<t>Like other optional extensions of <xref target="RFC7761"/> that are active
only when all routers indicate support for them, a single misconfigured or malicious
router emitting forged PIM Hello messages can inhibit operations of this extension.</t>

<t>Authentication of PIM messages such as explained in <xref target="RFC7761"/>, Sections 6.2 and 6.3 can
protect against the forged message attacks attacks.</t>

<t>Thorough AD review by John Scudder.</t>

<t>Functional enhancement: add requirement for existing implementation to be able to disable assert packing so that any possible compatibility issues introduced (which we think will not happen) can be avoided when upgrading to a packedassert version of the software. Also to allow performance comparison. No making a requirement for day 0 implementations because they may want to save the work of having a non-packed-assert code path.</t>

<t>Some rewrite to increase readibility, subdivided 3.3.1 into multiple subsections to better structure it.</t>

<t>Second round: some additional refinements to limit scope of prioriziation of messages, added security considerations.</t>

<t>Some nits.</t>

<t>Fixed up Reserved field of PackedAsserts to get back to 32 bit alignment
of the following fields (was down to 16 bits). Sorry, had a misinterpretation
reading rfc7761, though there ws something that had only made it 16 bit
aligned. Anyhow. Only this one change, 8 -&gt; 24 bit for this field.</t>

<t>review Alvaro Retana:
Reintroduced ref to PIM-DM, fixed typos, downgraded MAY-&gt;may for "sufficient".</t>

<t>IANA Expert Review / Stig Venaas:</t>

<t>Removed Count field from message headers as it complicates parsing and is unnecessary. Added "Zero" field to make packed asserts received by a non-packed-assert-capable-router guaranteed to fail ("Reserved" address family type).</t>

<t>Changed from RFC8736 to RFC8736bis so that we can use the word "Unassigned" in the IANA table.</t>

<t>Review Shuping Peng</t>

<t>Changed explanation of how assert packing works from "layer" to "alternative to
packetization via PIM Assert Message.
Fixed various typos, expanded term etc..</t>

<t>Review Robert Sparks:</t>

<t>Moved Intro explanations of how one could avoid asserts (but how its problematic) to appendix.
Applied textual nits found. Removed quotes around term "sufficient" for easier readbility.</t>

<t>Review Tommy Paul:</t>

<t>Transport related concern explained in reply, but
no additional explanations in text because the question referred to
basic PIM behavior expected to be understood by readers: No discovery
of loss/trigger for retransmission, just restransmission of same
message element after discover of ongoing duplicates and/or expiry
of timers.</t>

	 <t>   The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header format.  The
   common header definition contains eight reserved bits.  This document
   specifies how these bits may be used by individual message types and
   creates a registry containing the per-message-type usage.  This
   document also extends the PIM type space by defining three new
   message types.  For each of the new types, four of the previously
   reserved bits are used to form an extended type range.

   This document updates RFCs 7761 and 3973 by defining the use of the
   currently Reserved field in the PIM common header.  This document
   further updates RFCs 7761 and 3973, along with RFCs 5015, 5059, 6754,
   and 8364, by specifying the use of the currently reserved bits for
   each PIM message.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8736.

<section anchor="use-case-examples"><name>Use case examples</name>

<t>The PIM Assert mechanism can only be avoided by designing the network
to be without transit subnets with multiple upstream routers. For
example, an L2 ring between routers can sometimes be reconfigured to be a ring
of point-to-point subnets connected by the routers. These L2/L3 topology
changes are undesirable though, when they are only done to enable IP multicast
with PIM because they increase the cost of introducing IP multicast with PIM.</t>

<t>These designs are also not feasible when specific L2 technologies are needed.
For example various L2 technologies for rings provide sub 50msec failover
mechanisms, something not possible equally with an L3 subnet based ring. 
Likewise, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking mechanisms would require an
L2 topology that can not simply be replaced by an L3 topology.
L2 sub-topologies can also significantly reduce the cost of deployment.</t>

<t>The following subsections give examples of the type of network and use-cases
in which subnets with asserts have been observerd or are expected to require
scaling as provided by this specification.</t>

<section anchor="enterprise-network"><name>Enterprise network</name>

<t>When an Enterprise network is connected through a layer-2 network,
the intra-enterprise runs layer-3 PIM multicast. The different sites
of the enterprise are equivalent to the PIM connection through the
shared LAN network. Depending upon the locations and amount of
groups there could be many asserts on the first-hop routers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="video-surveillance"><name>Video surveillance</name>

<t>Video surveillance deployments have migrated from analog based
systems to IP-based systems oftentimes using multicast. In the
shared LAN network deployments, when there are many cameras
streaming to many groups there may be issues with many asserts on
first-hop routers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="financial-services"><name>Financial Services</name>

<t>Financial services extensively rely on IP Multicast to deliver stock
market data and its derivatives, and current multicast solution PIM
is usually deployed. As the number of multicast flows grow, there
are many stock data with many groups may result in many PIM asserts
on a shared LAN network from publisher to the subscribers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iptv-broadcast-video"><name>IPTV broadcast Video</name>

<t>PIM DR deployments are often used in host-side network for
IPTV broadcast video services. Host-side access network failure
scenario may be benefitted by assert packing when many groups are
being used. According to <xref target="RFC7761"/> the DR will be elected to forward
multicast traffic in the shared access network. When the DR recovers
from a failure, the original DR starts to send traffic, and the
current DR is still forwarding traffic. In the situation multicast
traffic duplication maybe happen in the shared access network and
can trigger the assert progress.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="mvpn-mdt"><name>MVPN MDT</name>

<t>As described in <xref target="RFC6037"/>, MDT (Multicast Distribution Tree) is used
as tunnels for MVPN. The configuration of multicast-enabled VRF (VPN
routing and forwarding) or interface that is in a VRF changing may
cause many assert packets to be sent in a same time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="special-l2-services"><name>Special L2 services</name>

<t>Additionally, future backhaul, or fronthaul, networks may want to
connect L3 across an L2 underlay supporting Time Sensitive Networks
(TSN). The infrastructure may run DetNet over TSN. These transit L2
LANs would have multiple upstreams and downstreams. This document is
taking a proactive approach to prevention of possible future assert
issues in these types of environments.</t>
